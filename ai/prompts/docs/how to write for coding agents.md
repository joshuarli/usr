This post - covers how to write your code so that agents navigate, parse, and read it more effectively: the names you choose, the types you define, and where you put your explanations. The results aren't hypothetical; in our tests, following the tips in this guide led to **fewer tokens and fewer agent turns** spent performing code retrieval, a **higher rate of bug detection**, and **fewer confidently wrong answers**.

But to understand how that's possible, we need to first understand: how do agents even search code?

## How agents search code (spoiler: it's text search)

Your coding agent frequently searches your repository for code. For example, want to rename a function? Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, etc. will all search your code to find all the references to that function that might need updating.

Claude Code session UI while the agent searches the repository.

Under the hood, most coding agents are just running `grep`– or rather, its faster cousin [ripgrep](https://github.com/burntsushi/ripgrep), aka `rg` – to rip through your code and find matching text references. The agent reads what comes back, and if it isn't enough context, repeats scanning your code until it has what it needs.

```
$ rg -l 'formatDuration' --type ts
packages/common/src/duration.ts
packages/common/src/duration.test.ts
apps/dashboard/src/lib/utils/dates.ts
apps/slack/src/lib/rate-limit.ts
...
```

This is a real example of Claude Code (w/ Fable 5) looking for references of `formatDuration` in the Modem repo.

Looking up text strings in files isn't the only way agents search: they also search by filename too. For example, if you ask a coding agent, "how does the session broker work?", agents are likely to scan your repository for lookalikes:

```
$ rg --files | rg -i 'session-broker|sessionBroker|session_broker'
apps/api/src/session-broker/index.ts
apps/api/src/session-broker/handler.ts
apps/api/src/session-broker/handler.test.ts
```

So paths are search terms too. A directory named `session-broker/` is a hit before the agent reads a single line of code.

Notice it's all just strings. There's no compiler feeding the agent a dependency graph, and no language server resolving symbols (usually, more on this below). The Claude Code team tried embeddings and a vector database early on and [threw them out](https://x.com/bcherny/status/2017824286489383315) because plain text search worked better. Academic agents landed in the same place; [SWE-agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15793) got its results by giving the model purpose-built keyword search tools and nothing fancier.

The agent navigation loop: search with rg, read a window around the best hit, loop back with a better query if needed, then start editing.

Even frontier models, given capable tools, typically navigate your code with what is essentially grep. And notice that the loop has one of the most important inputs the code's author controls: **whether the words in your code and the names on your files make good search terms.**

## Not all code is equally discoverable

Let's consider 3 hypothetical functions. They all do the same thing: create an API client object that makes HTTP requests to an external service (e.g. Stripe).

The only difference is how they're named:

```
export function create(apiKey: string) {
  // ...
}

export function createClient(apiKey: string) {
  // ...
}

export function createStripeClient(apiKey: string) {
  // ...
}
```

And here's how those functions might get invoked elsewhere in the codebase:

```
import { create } from '../api.ts';

const client = create(...);
client.getUsers(...);

// const client = createClient();
// const client = createStripeClient();
```

Let's say you're working on this code with an agent. You want to change the API client. Say, by adding a new method that calls a new HTTP API endpoint you've introduced. The agent will naturally try to discover all of the locations where this object is used. As we learned earlier, it will use grep/ripgrep.

Here's how many matches grep will return for these strings in our monorepo — about 2,900 TypeScript files — and how long each search takes using ripgrep (`rg`) on an M5-class MacBook.

| Search | Matching lines | Files | Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `create` | 1,585 | 459 | \~50ms |
| `createClient` | 466 | 23 | \~47ms |
| `createStripeClient` | 43 | 19 | \~47ms |

The 1,585 hits for `create` span hundreds of unrelated things: test fixtures, database inserts, workflow registrations. The 43 hits for `createStripeClient` are the definition, the call sites, and the tests — all about the same client.

You probably also noticed that ripgrep is *fast*. There's no meaningful time difference searching for `create`(50ms) or `createStripeClient` (47ms). But that's not the issue. The issue is how those hits affect your agent's context.

### Poor code discoverability eats context

Grep hands back matching lines, not answers. A hit like `const client = create(config)` doesn't tell the agent whether this is the client you care about or one of the hundreds of other things named `create`.

To find out, the agent reads a window around the hit, and often expands or opens additional sections. That can add up to anywhere from a few dozen lines to hundreds or thousands of lines of code.

```
$ rg -c 'create' --type ts | wc -l     # 459 files carry a match
459
# the agent opens the plausible ones and reads each in full:
#   apps/ingest/src/jobs/register.ts      (~220 lines)  → a workflow registration, not it
#   packages/database/src/seed.ts         (~110 lines)  → a database insert, not it
#   apps/dashboard/src/hooks/use-form.ts   (~70 lines)  → a form factory, not it
# ...more files, before the real one turns up
```

At roughly ten tokens a line, each file read is hundreds to thousands of tokens spent to rule out one wrong candidate. Work through a dozen and you've burned tens of thousands of tokens separating signal from noise, before a line of the actual task is written.

Whereas searching for the specific name skips the sifting:

```
$ rg -l 'createStripeClient' --type ts
apps/payments/src/stripe-client.ts
apps/payments/src/checkout.ts
apps/payments/src/stripe-client.test.ts
# Just 3 files to read instead of 459
```

Three files, all about the same client. And the saving compounds. Context is finite, so every token spent ruling out `create` fixtures is one the agent no longer has for your change. Worse, as its context fills with near-misses, models get [measurably less reliable](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.05381v1) at using what's actually in there. A name that grep resolves in one hop keeps both the agent's attention and its budget on the task.

## Modules won't save a generic name

So far we've been talking about pure symbol lookup. But what about imports and modules?

Let's return to our earlier `client` TypeScript example:

```
import { create } from '../api.ts';

const client = create(...);
client.getUsers(...);
```

At the top of this file is a pretty clear clue about the location of the `client` function definition. Why grep through the codebase when we can just look up the file here?

If the goal was strictly to find the definition, you'd be right. An import is a forward pointer: given a call site, it tells you where the definition lives.

But the task that opened this post was a rename. That's the reverse direction — given a definition, find every caller — and plain-text search provides no reverse index. Nothing in `api.ts` records who imports it. (Some languages are better at this; more on this below.)

### Reverse symbol lookups

Say `create` has three call sites, each using an ordinary import style:

```
// relative path
import { create } from '../../../packages/common/src/api';

// package specifier, via a barrel
import { create } from '@modem/common';

// renamed import
import { create as createApiClient } from '@modem/common';
```

Now try to find them all by text:

```
$ rg -l "from '.*api'"     # 1 of 3 — package specifiers don't contain the path
$ rg -n '\bcreate\('       # 2 of 3 — misses the rename, plus every unrelated create()
```

Neither query above finds all three cleanly — except a name distinctive enough that grepping it returns only real usages. The import graph exists in your code, but it isn't greppable in reverse. For a grep-first agent, a distinctive symbol name is the most portable reverse lookup.

### Barrels and package specifiers

Even the forward direction — call site to definition — degrades in a monorepo. The import at the top of our file says `create` comes from `@modem/common`. But `@modem/common` isn't a path; it's a package specifier. To follow it, the agent first has to find out where that package lives, which means opening `package.json` or grepping for the package name.

That lands it on the barrel file:

```
// packages/common/src/index.ts
export * from './api';
export * from './auth';
export * from './duration';
export * from './validation';
```

Which re-export has `create`? The barrel doesn't say. The `export *` erases the names it forwards, so the agent is back to grepping inside the package to find the actual definition. The same search it could have started with, now 3 hops later.

### Methods on objects

Methods never had imports at all. Look at the call we've been working with:

```
const client = create(...);
client.getUsers(...);
```

No import statement anywhere mentions `getUsers`; imports traffic in modules and their top-level exports, and a method is neither. The only way a grep-first agent finds where `getUsers` is defined, or who calls it, is searching the name. And unlike the two failures above, this isn't TypeScript's fault: `client.getUsers()` leaves the same nonexistent trail in Python, Go, Ruby, and Java. Without semantic tooling, method names are usually the best textual handle an agent has.

Modules point one direction, blur behind barrels and package specifiers, and say nothing about the methods on your objects. The name still does the lifting.

## Types force better discoverability

Names help the agent find your code; types tell it how to use that code. And unlike a comment or a README, a type is enforced.

Put another way: the agent may skip your docs. But when it runs the compiler, type errors provide fast, concrete feedback. An invalid call produces an error the agent can use to correct its approach - often within one turn.

Before the compiler catches anything, though, types are already paying for themselves, because a precise signature can often answer the agent’s first questions without requiring it to read the implementation. Consider this one:

```
function enrichUser(user: User): EnrichedUser
```

The agent sees this in a grep result and keeps moving. What goes in (`User`), what comes out (`EnrichedUser`). Depending on the question being asked, there may be no reason to open the function body. Now the untyped version:

```
function enrichUser(data) {

// or
function enrichUser(data: any) {
```

To learn what `data` is, the agent likely has to read the implementation. If the implementation passes `data` along to something else, it reads that too, and probably a caller or two. One missing annotation can turn a one-line read into several file reads.

Note that TypeScript's `any` does the same damage while *looking* like a type; every `any` increases the chance that the agent will need to read the implementation.

### Type quality matters

So just the presence of types can reduce agent reads. But the descriptiveness of those types also matters.

Consider this function:

```
function transferOwnership(userId: string, orgId: string, projectId: string) {
  // ...
}

// accidental swapped args
transferOwnership(orgId, projectId, userId);
```

Since every argument is typed `string`, the compiler doesn't catch an accidental argument swap. But what if instead the IDs have distinct types (branded types in TypeScript, newtypes in Rust)?

```
function transferOwnership(userId: UserId, orgId: OrgId, projectId: ProjectId) {
  // ...
}
```

Now the swap becomes a build error:

```
Argument of type `OrgId` is not assignable to parameter of type `UserId`.
```

The agent hits that error, fixes it, and moves on, usually in one turn. Researchers have watched this loop work: [one study of compiler feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15188) saw models roughly triple their success rate over a handful of error-and-retry rounds.

Here's where it ties back to everything above. That error names a type — `OrgId`— and `OrgId` is almost certainly defined in another file. To act on the error, the agent has to go read that definition, and it gets there the only way it knows how: it searches the name.

A type name is a search term exactly like a function name, and it obeys the same rule. `OrgId` or `UserEnrichmentResult` greps to one definition; a `Result`, a `Data`, a `Config` drops the agent back into the multi-hit haystack from earlier. The compiler tells it where to look; the name decides how long the looking takes.

Which is the full case against `any`: nothing for the compiler to say, nothing for the agent to search. A bad name at least leaves a trail.

## Smaller applications of the same idea

By now the pattern is clear: make the words in your code good search terms. Most of what's left is the same idea applied in smaller places.

**Put the comment on the definition**. An agent reaches your code by searching a name, and the search resolves to where that name is defined — so the definition is the one spot you can count on it reading. That makes the one-line comment directly above a definition the most cost-effective documentation you can write: it sits exactly where searches land. Write a sentence about the thing the code can't say itself.

**Pick one spelling per concept**. Try to name distinct concepts uniquely. For example, don't call it `organizations` in one place and `customers` somewhere else - even using a local import alias. Even synonyms in your codebase can lead to confusion (e.g. `orgId` vs `organizationId`), but agents seem to navigate those more successfully.

**Name tests after the source they cover**. We intentionally name test files after the code they cover (e.g. `stripe.test.ts` to test `stripe.ts`). We've observed that without obvious names, agents take extra turns to find a match.

**Mark legacy paths @deprecated**. If you're keeping legacy code around for one reason or another, be sure to mark it as deprecated (e.g. using TypeScript's `@deprecated` tag). Otherwise agents will discover and use code you don't want them to. Better yet, strive to remove the code entirely.

**Write the conventions file**. You probably already have an `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`. Make sure to record anything non-obvious, like naming conventions, source code locations, etc. It's the highest-leverage habit for ensuring agents navigate your code effectively.

## Is this all vibes? Let's go to the tapes

So far, we’ve made the case in theory. But does it make a difference in practice?

To try and answer that, we had Fable 5 distill this blog post into a [`write-discoverable-code`](https://github.com/modem-dev/skills/tree/main/write-discoverable-code) skill file - a one-page set of rules loaded into the agent's context when it writes code. We then compared how other agents retrieved and reasoned about code produced with and without those rules, in a set of isolated experiments.

One caveat before we get into the results: this is surprisingly hard to test cleanly. How easily an agent navigates a codebase depends on the code itself, the task, the model and harness, and plenty else. Plus the advice in this post (captured in the skill file) changes several things at once: names, files, types, structure, etc. It's a lot of variables.

These aren’t meant to be definitive benchmarks. They’re smaller, scoped experiments asking a simpler question: **when the task and surrounding repo stay roughly the same, is code written for discoverability easier for search-driven agents to navigate**?

### Experiment 1: Generated library (TypeScript)

The goal of this experiment was to see if brand-new agent-generated code using our skill file led to better agent retrieval results vs without it.

2 authors

Haiku 4.5 Claude Code

GPT-5.6 Sol Codex CLI

each writes twice

4 versions

\+ same **500-file repo**

14 reader configs

fresh session

search + read

no skill file

where is the retry delay computed?

Two author agents generate four code variants; fourteen separate reader configs then search each version. The readers never see the skill file.

To do that, we started with a neutral spec for a small notification pipeline library, featuring retries, rate limiting, payload signing, etc. Then we gave it two different author agents: **Haiku 4.5** in Claude Code and **GPT-5.6 Sol** in Codex CLI. Each author generated the library twice: once unassisted and once with the `write-discoverable-code.md` skill loaded. That gave us four versions of the same library:

1. **Haiku 4.5** (Claude Code) - unassisted
2. **Haiku 4.5**(Claude Code) -* with skill file loaded*
3. **GPT-5.6 Sol** (Codex CLI) - unassisted
4. **GPT-5.6 Sol**(Codex CLI) -* with skill file loaded*

We chose Haiku 4.5 as an intentionally small author model, and its unassisted version produced exactly the kind of code this post warns about. With the skill loaded, the difference showed up immediately in the names:

| Haiku 4.5 - unassisted | Haiku 4.5 - skill assisted |
| --- | --- |
| `signer.ts`| ` hmac-payload-signer.ts` |
| `queue.ts`| ` channel-router.ts` |
| `validateConfig()`| ` validateNotificationDeliveryConfig()` |

On the other hand, GPT-5.6 Sol’s unassisted code was already shaped for discoverability: `calculateBackoffDelay` in `backoff.ts`, `TokenBucket` in `token-bucket.ts`. In this run, Sol produced specific, discoverable names without any additional guidance.

With the skill loaded, Sol went further – e.g. `backoff.ts` became `notification-retry-backoff.ts` – but the gap between its two versions was visibly narrower than Haiku’s. (As a matter of personal taste, I felt this code was arguably over-specified.)

Next, we tested how other agents read the four library versions. We buried each one among the same 500 files of real code from our monorepo (to see the hypothetical impact in our existing code). We then started fresh agent CLI sessions restricted to search and read tools, and asked questions like:

```
Where is the wait time before the next retry attempt computed?
Where is the computed HMAC signature attached to the outgoing payload before delivery?
Where can I look up all past delivery attempts for a given notification id?
...
```

Fourteen model/harness combinations answered 10 questions three times against each version: 1,680 runs in total. For each run, we recorded token spend and whether the answer was correct.

Table 2: Same experiment, authored by GPT-5.6 Sol / Codex CLI. Better unassisted code leaves less to save; the skill still helps almost everyone.

Read together, the tables show a larger effect where the unassisted author produced more generic code. In these runs, the median reduction was 32% for Haiku-authored code and 12% for Sol-authored code. Twelve of the fourteen Sol reader configurations improved; two did not. The skill acted like a floor in these runs when the author left more room for improvement, though the experiment doesn’t isolate naming from the other changes introduced by the skill.

Reader behavior also mattered. One row deserves its own sentence: Sol reading its own unassisted code still got 13 to 38 percent cheaper (depending on the harness driving it) when that code was written under the skill. The model that wrote the code has no privileged memory of where things live. It runs the same searches everyone else does.

The wrong answers, meanwhile, turned out to belong to one table only. On Haiku's generic code, unassisted sessions returned confidently wrong answers - asked about the notification library's delivery history, an agent pointed at a Slack delivery ledger elsewhere in the repo; asked where the HMAC signature gets attached, two pointed at our media-proxy's URL signer. The skill-named code produced zero, because near-miss code can't wear a name like `hmac-payload-signer.ts`. On Sol's code this failure mode essentially vanished in both versions (834 of 840 runs correct, the errors one-off and split across both arms). In these runs, the confidently wrong answers clustered in the generic-named Haiku version.

## Experiment 2: PewDiePie's Odysseus repo (Python)

Synthetic codebases only show so much, so we also tested the idea against a difficult real-world case: [Odysseus](https://github.com/odysseus-dev/odysseus)’s unusually large email subsystem. Odysseus is the self-hosted AI workspace that picked up tens of thousands of GitHub stars in its first week — an impressive thing for a self-taught coder to ship — and `routes/email_routes.py` ([see on GitHub](https://github.com/odysseus-dev/odysseus/blob/dev/routes/email_routes.py)) is 4,943 lines, about 3,900 of them a single function holding all 81 route handlers as nested closures. One function, the entire email client.

[![Odysseus AI workspace UI: dark theme with a pink Odysseus logo, sidebar of tools, and a chat input set to Agent mode.](https://modem.dev/images/how-coding-agents-odysseus.png)](https://modem.dev/images/how-coding-agents-odysseus.png)

Odysseus, the self-hosted AI workspace that racked up tens of thousands of GitHub stars in its first week.

We refactored just that one file (`email_routes.py`) using Claude Code + Sonnet 5 under the skill - same behavior, same routes, verified mechanically - reorganized into concept-named modules:

Before

email_routes.py
4,943 lines
81 nested handlers

After

email/
smtp_settings.py
message_rendering.py
folder_fallbacks.py
delivery_history.py

Then asked a mix of agents / harnesses the same six questions about both versions:

```
"Where does the code check that SMTP settings are complete enough to send outgoing mail?"
"Where is markdown converted to HTML when composing an outgoing email?"
"When the user's preferred mail folder does not exist on the IMAP server, where does the code pick a fallback folder instead?"
...
```

Here's how each model / agent harness performed. (Fewer model/harness combinations this time because we're not made of infinite credits.)

| Model | Tokens / questionmonolith → refactored | Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Haiku 4.5· Claude Code | 290,324→190,811 | −34.3% |
| Grok 4.5· OpenCode | 25,600→17,535 | −31.5% |
| GPT-5.6 Sol· Codex CLI | 72,072→67,843 | −5.9% |
| Sonnet 5· Claude Code | 198,291→190,569 | −3.9% |

One refactor, generated once by an agent following the skill; every model reads the same two codebases. Mean tokens per question, 3 runs each. Token counts comparable within a row, not across harnesses.

The pattern from the generated-library tables shows up again: the models that were lost in the monolith saved the most. Haiku had been burning 400,000-token sessions paging through one wall of code; after the refactor, it stopped. Grok saved a third. Sol and Sonnet were never really lost, and broke roughly even.

The traces suggest filenames were a major contributor, although the refactor also changed file sizes and module boundaries. When the agent is looking for email folder logic, and it lives in a reasonably-named file like `email_folders.py`, the agent finds it without opening anything else.

But the refactor's bigger effect is on the worst case. Nearly every catastrophe run - e.g. a 400k-token search that ends with no answer - happened in the original monolith. Nearly, because Haiku produced one in the refactored version too, and the location is telling. Our experiment only refactored a single file, and Haiku got lost in a related-but-unaltered 1,800-line `email_helpers.py` grab-bag. The refactor raised the floor, and the new floor became the worst file left standing.

### Experiment 2.5: Odysseus bug hunt

One last test: does legibility change what agents get right, not just what they spend? We planted four subtle bugs in two versions of that email code - byte-identical edits, so each version contains exactly the same defects - and asked four models to verify the relevant requirements under a fixed eight-turn review budget. Each model reviewed each bug twice.

Same four planted bugs, same eight-turn budget. Each square is one review. In the monolith, Haiku and Sonnet's failed reviews mostly ran out of budget without a verdict; in the reorganized code they caught all eight.

The newest and most advanced frontier models we tested, Grok 4.5 and GPT-5.6 Sol, caught every bug in both versions. Eight turns is enough for a disciplined searcher to grep its way to any of these defects, even inside a 4,943-line file.

But Haiku and Sonnet couldn't pull off the same feat: they caught 4 of 8 and 3 of 8, and the failures were rarely wrong answers - they were reviews that burned the entire budget paging through the file and never reached a verdict at all. In the reorganized code, both went a perfect 8/8.

The Sonnet row is also worth noticing: in the earlier Odysseus retrieval test it *barely* benefited from a refactor at all. And under a review budget its accuracy still went from 3 of 8 to 8 of 8. Being able to afford lookups in a monolith is not the same as being able to reach conclusions in one.

Across these experiments, easier retrieval left agents more budget to do the actual work. That showed up as cheaper lookups, fewer wrong answers, and more bugs caught before the turn limit.

## Wrapping up: yes, the code matters

To recap: agents navigate your codebase by string search, they trust what your names tell them, the compiler is the one reviewer they can't ignore, and what they read first is largely determined by where search lands. And when we put that to the test in a series of experiments, it held up.

In our synthetic generation test using a weaker code author (Haiku 4.5), all fourteen model/harness pairs read the skill-written code for fewer tokens - between 6% and 66% fewer - and confidently wrong answers disappeared. On the stronger author's code (GPT-5.6 Sol), 12 of 14 model/harness pairs performed better, and the remaining two did not improve.

In our experiment involving an existing vibe-generated repo (Odysseus), the same refactor cut token spend by about a third for the models that were getting lost — and broke even for the ones that weren't. In the bug hunt, reviews went from 23 of 32 correct in the monolith to 32 of 32 in the refactor, with the two weaker models going from 7/16 to a perfect 16/16, because they spent their budget judging instead of finding.

We don't want to oversell the data. Our repo measurements are observational, and the controlled experiment is one spec and a couple thousand runs. Harnesses will keep evolving too - [Cursor has published respectable numbers](https://cursor.com/blog/semsearch) showing embeddings help on top of grep, so plain text search may not be the endgame. But grep, repo maps, and embeddings all feed on the same input: the words in your source. Better names improve all of them. That's about as safe as bets get in this business.

The funny thing is that almost none of this is new advice. Descriptive names, precise types, comments that explain the why - we've been telling each other to do these things for decades, and mostly forgiving ourselves when we didn't, because a person can always ask a teammate or dig through git blame. The agent can't. It has your text, your types, and a search box. Write for that reader, and the code gets better for everyone.
