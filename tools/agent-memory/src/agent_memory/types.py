"""Shared closed vocabularies for the agent-memory project.

Harness names, finding states, signals, tiers, and retry kinds are closed
sets: a typo is a bug, not a new variant. They are typed as Literals so the
checker rejects misspellings at the boundary where a dynamic string enters.
Event kinds stay open (adapters emit ``unknown:<...>`` for shapes they do not
recognize), so kinds remain plain strings grouped by the *_KINDS tuples.
